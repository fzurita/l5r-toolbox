This app is designed to be a dice roller as well as a health tracker for the Legend of the Five Rings role playing game. It has been equipped with tools for all the rolling intricacies that have been encountered so far in my playing sessions.

This app supports automatic calculation of complicated rolls by applying all the rolling rules: ie. 18k10, 15k2, 10k12, etc.

This app also offers a roll simulator that will make a number of rolls to figure out the average result as well as the chance to hit a provided target number.
